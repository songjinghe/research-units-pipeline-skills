  Screen the direction pool with a discussion-first scoring pass, writing `output/trace/IDEA_SCREENING_TABLE.md`.
  **Trigger**: idea screener, screening table, brainstorm screening, 方向筛选表.
  **Use when**: you already have a direction pool and want a table-first comparison before curating the shortlist.
  **Skip if**: the direction pool is still missing or obviously templated.
  **Network**: none.
  **Guardrail**: no invented papers; scoring should reflect discussion value and distinctness, not stylistic polish.

# Idea Screener

Goal: compress a direction pool into a scored comparison table that helps shortlist the most discussion-worthy directions.

The screener should reward:
- advisor-useful rank separation,
- distinct contribution shapes,
- concrete prior-work grounding,
and penalize same-template directions that only swap nouns.
