name: idea-brief
description: |
  Lock an ideation run into a single-source-of-truth brainstorm brief (`output/trace/IDEA_BRIEF.md`) and a replayable multi-query plan (`queries.md`).
  **Trigger**: idea brief, ideation brief, research ideas, brainstorm, 找 idea, 选题, 点子, 找方向.
  **Use when**: the user wants research ideas and their input is long / multi-turn; you need to clarify topic + constraints before retrieval.
  **Skip if**: the goal is to write a survey draft directly (use `arxiv-survey*` pipelines instead).
  **Network**: none.
  **Guardrail**: do not invent papers/citations; do not start retrieval here; keep the brief structured (no long prose).

# Idea Brief

Turn a fuzzy ideation request into an auditable brainstorm contract for the later ideation stack.

This skill does **not** retrieve papers.
It only locks topic, audience, constraints, exclusions, rubric, query buckets, and target artifact shape into:

- `output/trace/IDEA_BRIEF.md`
- `queries.md`
- `DECISIONS.md`

## Inputs
- `GOAL.md`
- `DECISIONS.md`
- `queries.md`

## Outputs
- `output/trace/IDEA_BRIEF.md`
- `queries.md`
- `DECISIONS.md`

## Execution notes

This skill starts from `GOAL.md`, then refines the topic/constraints into `output/trace/IDEA_BRIEF.md`, updates `queries.md`, and records blockers or approvals in `DECISIONS.md`.

Read `references/overview.md` before changing the package shape or the brief contract.
`assets/brief_contract.json` is the machine-readable source for:

- required brief sections
- goal / audience framing
- rubric rows
- query bucket templates
- default exclusions
- focus placeholder
- shared table/open-question text
- decisions bootstrap text
