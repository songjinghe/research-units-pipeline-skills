## 1. What This Workflow Is For

`evidence-review` is for protocol-driven evidence synthesis across a candidate study pool.

It is the high-rigor path for questions like:

- what does the available evidence support?
- what survives screening and extraction?
- where are the bias and heterogeneity limits?

The main output is:

- `output/SYNTHESIS.md`

## 2. Why This Is Not Just A Bigger Brief

This workflow is deliberately heavier than `research-brief`.

Its contract includes:

- protocol
- candidate-pool auditability
- screening log
- extraction table
- bias assessment
- bounded synthesis

That is why it remains a separate execution contract instead of being folded into a light briefing path.

## 3. When To Use It

Use `evidence-review` when:

- you need an auditable review question
- you expect explicit inclusion/exclusion rules
- you need screening and extraction before prose
- you want conclusions bounded by bias and heterogeneity

Do not use it when:

- you only need a quick orientation memo
- you are evaluating one paper rather than a pool

## 4. Stage Flow

| Stage | Purpose | Main outputs |
|---|---|---|
| `C0` | initialize workspace and review question | `STATUS.md`, `UNITS.csv`, `DECISIONS.md`, `queries.md` |
| `C1` | write and approve the protocol | `output/PROTOCOL.md` |
| `C2` | build the auditable candidate pool | `papers/papers_raw.jsonl`, `papers/papers_dedup.jsonl`, `papers/core_set.csv` |
| `C3` | screen studies against protocol clauses | `papers/screening_log.csv` |
| `C4` | extract study fields and bias data | `papers/extraction_table.csv` |
| `C5` | write and self-check the synthesis | `output/SYNTHESIS.md`, `output/DELIVERABLE_SELFLOOP_TODO.md` |

## 5. Quality Bar

The synthesis should:

- stay traceable to the extraction table
- separate supported conclusions from weak evidence
- report limitations and bias explicitly
- avoid acting like a generic long-form summary

## 6. Recommended Prompt

```text
Use the evidence-review workflow to run a PRISMA-style review on LLM agents for education, with protocol, screening, extraction, and a bounded synthesis.
```
