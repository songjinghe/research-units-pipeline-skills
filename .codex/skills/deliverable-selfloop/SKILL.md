name: deliverable-selfloop
description: |
  Self-loop a deliverable until it is publishable by the pipeline standard: diagnose -> fix -> re-check, and write a PASS/FAIL report.
  **Trigger**: self loop, self-loop, polish deliverable, quality gate, fix-on-fail, 收敛, 自循环, 质量门.
  **Use when**: A pipeline has produced a reader-facing deliverable (`output/*.md`) and you want deterministic convergence to PASS.
  **Skip if**: You are still pre-approval for prose or the upstream evidence/structure artifacts are missing.
  **Network**: none.
  **Guardrail**: Do not invent papers/citations/results. Only use in-scope inputs already present in the workspace.

# Deliverable Self-Loop (fix-on-fail)

Goal: converge a pipeline deliverable to a stable, reader-facing quality bar.

For the ideation path, the target is now a **brainstorm memo bundle**:
- `output/REPORT.md`
- `output/APPENDIX.md`
- `output/REPORT.json`
- plus the supporting trace chain under `output/trace/`
